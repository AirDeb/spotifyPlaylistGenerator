# spotifyPlaylistGenerator
This generates a playlist for you based on your preferred genre, most recently listened music, top listened to artists, top tracks, top albums. 

This playlist generator works more efficiently when you choose a genre that you listen to frequently based on the algorithm. 
To access this, the client secret must be obtained by the developer for proper authorization of the API.


IMPORTANT: Make sure you enter the username that is under your account overview under Spotify. Your username should be located here under your profile:

To run the program, go into the work directory by setting the directory on your terminal as the downloaded folder (final_playlist_generator).
After setting the directory on your terminal, type into the terminal "python frontend.py" (without the quotation marks)
If you have done that properly, you should be on the application. It will look something like this:

NOTE: The maximum playlists you can enter is 100 because that is the maximum that Spotify's API allows. Otherwise, you will get an error message.


Enjoy and happy listening!
